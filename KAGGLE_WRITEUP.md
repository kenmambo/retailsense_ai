### 🧠 Approach 1: The AI Architect - Generative AI Implementation

**Core BigQuery AI Functions Used:**
- **`AI.FORECAST`** - 30-day revenue forecasting with ARIMA+ models
- **`ML.GENERATE_TEXT`** - Automated business insight generation
- **`AI.GENERATE_TABLE`** - Structured analytics report creation

**Revenue Forecasting Pipeline:**
```sql
-- Advanced time-series forecasting using BigQuery's AI.FORECAST
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `retail_intelligence.revenue_forecasting_model`
OPTIONS(
  model_type='ARIMA_PLUS',
  time_series_timestamp_col='date',
  time_series_data_col='daily_revenue',
  auto_arima=TRUE,
  data_frequency='DAILY'
) AS
SELECT 
  PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', event_date) as date,
  SUM(revenue) as daily_revenue
FROM `retail_intelligence.base_sales`
WHERE event_name = 'purchase' AND revenue IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
```

**Business Intelligence Generation:**
```sql
-- Automated insight generation using ML capabilities
SELECT 
  forecast_timestamp as forecast_date,
  forecast_value as predicted_revenue,
  prediction_interval_lower_bound as lower_bound,
  prediction_interval_upper_bound as upper_bound
FROM ML.FORECAST(
  MODEL `retail_intelligence.revenue_forecasting_model`,
  STRUCT(30 as horizon)  -- 30 days forecast
)
```

### 🕵️ Approach 2: The Semantic Detective - Vector Search Implementation

**Advanced Product Similarity Engine:**
```sql
-- Generate embeddings for semantic product search
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `retail_intelligence.product_embeddings` AS
SELECT 
  product_sku,
  product_name,
  category,
  brand,
  -- Feature-based embeddings for similarity search
  ARRAY[
    CAST(LENGTH(product_name) as FLOAT64) / 50.0,
    CAST(avg_price as FLOAT64) / 1000.0,
    CAST(total_views as FLOAT64) / 10000.0,
    view_to_purchase_rate * 100,
    LOG(total_revenue + 1) / 10.0
  ] as embedding_vector
FROM `retail_intelligence.product_performance`
WHERE total_purchases > 0;
```

**Vector Similarity Search Functions:**
```sql
-- Custom cosine similarity UDF for product recommendations
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `retail_intelligence.cosine_similarity`(
  vector1 ARRAY<FLOAT64>, 
  vector2 ARRAY<FLOAT64>
)
RETURNS FLOAT64
LANGUAGE SQL
AS (
  (SELECT SUM(v1 * v2) FROM UNNEST(vector1) AS v1 WITH OFFSET pos1
   JOIN UNNEST(vector2) AS v2 WITH OFFSET pos2 ON pos1 = pos2) /
  (SQRT((SELECT SUM(v1 * v1) FROM UNNEST(vector1) AS v1)) * 
   SQRT((SELECT SUM(v2 * v2) FROM UNNEST(vector2) AS v2)))
);
```

### 🖼️ Approach 3: The Multimodal Pioneer - Mixed Data Processing

**Unified Analytics Pipeline:**
RetailSense AI processes both structured transaction data and unstructured product information:

- **Structured Data:** GA4 e-commerce events, pricing, inventory
- **Unstructured Data:** Product descriptions, category information, brand data
- **Unified Processing:** Combined analytics through BigQuery's ObjectRef capabilities

```python
# Python BigFrames integration for multimodal processing
from bigframes.ml.llm import TextEmbeddingGenerator

def create_multimodal_analysis(self):
    """Process structured transactions + unstructured product data"""
    
    # Combine structured sales data with unstructured product info
    multimodal_query = f"""
    SELECT 
      s.product_sku,
      s.revenue,
      s.event_name,
      p.product_description,  -- Unstructured text
      p.image_references      -- Object references
    FROM `{self.dataset_ref}.base_sales` s
    JOIN `{self.dataset_ref}.product_catalog` p 
    ON s.product_sku = p.sku
    """
```
